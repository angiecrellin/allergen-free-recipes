Black Bean Burgers

Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
½ medium yellow onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons parsley
½ cup oat flour
½ cup ground flax meal
¼ cup chickpea flour
salt and black pepper

Directions:
In a large bowl, mash black beans. leave some beans whole.
Add remaining ingredients and mix until combined.
Form into patties (approximately ¼ - ½ cup per patty). Set aside what you want to eat, and place the rest on a baking sheet and freeze.
Cook in pan over medium-high heat, approximately 4-5 minutes per side or until browned.
Serve on bun of choice with your favorite toppings. I like caramelized onions, hummus, and lettuce
Notes:
The chickpea flour is a binding agent and really helps to hold the burgers together. You can make it without it, you just might have some delicious tasting burgers that don't hold together very well.

Crockpot Hungarian Goulash

Ingredients: 1 1/2 lb lean stew beef
1/4 cup flour
salt and pepper to taste
2 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp Hungarian paprika
small bag baby carrots
8 ribs celery, diced large
2 medium onions, diced large
2 cloves garlic, minced
water
4 large potatoes, diced large 
1 1/2 cups frozen peas (optional)

Directions:

Cut meat into bite sized pieces. Coat meat with flour seasoned with salt and pepper. Be generous with the salt as this dish tends to take a lot of salt. Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet and brown meat on all sides. Add more oil if sticking occurs. Add paprika and saute for about 1 more minute. 

Layer ingredients in crock pot and add water just to cover. Cook on low for 8-10 hours on until everything is tender. You can cook it on high for about 5 hours, on the stovetop in a heavy covered pot on a very low simmer, or in a tightly covered casserole in the oven at 325 °F. Stir occasionally, especially if using one of the quicker cooking methods.

If using potatoes, add after 4 hours of cooking. Add them during the last 1 1/2 to 2 hours if using the faster cooking methods. Stir occasionally. Add peas during the last hour of cooking if using. Adjust seasoning before serving.
